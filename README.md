## What is User Story Mapping?

User story mapping is a technique for organizing user stories into a visual map that helps teams understand the big picture of a product.

**Structure:**
- **Personas** - Who are the users?
- **Activities** - What are they trying to achieve?
- **Steps** (Backbone) - The journey from left to right
- **User Stories** - Details under each step
- **Slices** - Horizontal groupings for releases (MVP, v1, v2, etc.)
