## What is User Story Mapping?
User story mapping is a technique for organising user stories into a visual map that helps teams understand the big picture of a software project, feature, or product. More importantly, it helps teams agree on what the product should do and how it should be built. It acts as a canonical source of information for the team that can be referenced throughout the project.

It's not a replacement for Jira, Trello, Phabricator, or any other project management tool. Instead, it's used alongside them to visualise the big picture of the work being done, track progress, and keep everyone aligned on the value being delivered.

### The Power of the Big Picture
User story mapping transforms a flat agile backlog into a living visual narrative that helps your team never lose sight of the user's journey. While traditional tools are excellent for tracking individual tasks, they often obscure the "why" behind the work.

By mapping out the user journey upfront, you can instantly spot functional gaps. For example, let's say you're building an online store for a local sign shop that makes custom signs. You'd presumably plan out steps including "Browse Designs" → "Customise Text" → "Confirm Dimensions" → "Approve" → "Checkout". That seems like a sensible linear flow in your scrum backlog.

You then start the implementation, and you work through the first three stages, all good, until you hit "Approve", and then you realise that in your planning, you forgot to account for the revision cycle needed if the customer's design isn't approved. Implementation then stops due to a new discussion being needed. After discussing it with stakeholders, you settle on a new additional flow of "Revise Design" → "Revise Dimensions" → "Re-approve". This discovery increases your workload from five steps to eight and forces a mid-sprint halt for stakeholder discussions. Encountering this kind of "hidden" work can happen many times during a project, sometimes surfacing complexities you never anticipated in the original design, leading to frustration, scope creep, and late deliveries.

Alternatively, with User Story Mapping, everyone is in the room during the mapping session, so the question "What happens if they don't approve?" inevitably surfaces early, revealing the missing path in the customer's journey upfront. You have the conversation before the implementation starts, capture it in the map, and reduce disruptions to the project during implementation while building shared understanding across stakeholders and the technical team. **Flat backlogs hide complexity; User Story Maps expose it.**

### User Story Mapping Structure:
- **Users** - Who are the users? e.g. first-time shopper
- **Activities** - What are they trying to achieve? e.g. find a product
- **Steps** - The journey they take to achieve their goals from left to right e.g. search -> browse -> compare
- **Tasks** - The work to support each step e.g. keyword search, category filters, compare products
- **Slices** - Horizontal groupings for releases (MVP, v1, v2, etc.)

## App Features
- **Real-time Collaboration** - Multiple users can edit the same map simultaneously with conflict-free merging powered by Yjs CRDTs
- **Live Cursors** - See other users' cursors and selections in real-time
- **Live Viewer Count** - See how many people are viewing the map in real-time
- **Shareable URLs** - Each map gets a unique URL for easy sharing
- **Users** - Add context rows showing who does what
- **Activities & Steps (Backbone)** - Define activities & steps representing the user journey left-to-right
- **Tasks** - Add task cards under each step to break down the work
- **Release Slices** - Group tasks horizontally into releases or priorities
- **Status Indicators** - Mark tasks as done, in-progress, or planned
- **Colours & Links** - Customise card colours and add external URLs to your existing task management tools
- **Drag & Drop** - Reorder cards and slices
- **Lock Maps** - Password-protect maps to prevent edits; unlock anytime to resume editing
- **Undo/Redo** - Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y to undo and redo changes
- **Zoom Controls** - Zoom out to see the full board, zoom in for detail
- **Print / PDF** - Print your story map or save as PDF
- **Export to Jira** - Export your map as epics and stories to Jira via CSV import or the REST API
- **Export to Phabricator** - Export your map as tasks and subtasks to Phabricator via the Maniphest API
- **Import/Export JSON** - Save and load story maps as JSON files
- **Local Storage** - Automatically saves your work
- **Samples** - Load example story maps to learn the framework

## Self-Hosting Setup

This app uses Firebase for real-time collaboration and cloud storage. To run your own instance:

1. Create a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Firestore Database in your project
3. Enable Realtime Database in your project (for live viewer count)
4. Set up App Check with reCAPTCHA v3 at [console.cloud.google.com/security/recaptcha](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/recaptcha)
5. Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js`
6. Add your Firebase credentials, database URL, and reCAPTCHA site key to `config.js`
7. Serve the files with any static web server

Note: Data is always saved to local storage. Real-time collaboration and cloud sync require Firebase.

## Usage
1. Visit [storymaps.io](https://storymaps.io) or run locally with `npx serve -s` (SPA mode for client-side routing)
2. Click **New Story Map** or try a sample to get started
3. Click **+** to add steps (columns) to the backbone
4. Click **+** in a column to add tasks
5. Click **+ Add Slice** to create release groupings
6. Click the **...** menu on cards to set colours, status, or links
7. Drag tasks to reorder or move between columns
8. Click **Share** to copy the URL and collaborate with others
9. Use **Menu → Lock Map** to password-protect the map from edits
10. Use **Ctrl+Z** / **Ctrl+Y** to undo and redo changes
11. Use zoom controls (bottom-right) to zoom in/out
12. Use **Menu → Export** to save as JSON or export to Jira/Phabricator
13. Use **Print** to save as PDF
