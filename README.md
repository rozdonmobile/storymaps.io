## What is User Story Mapping?

User story mapping is a technique for organising stories into a visual map that shows the entire product life cycle at a glance. It helps teams build a shared understanding of what a product does, who it serves, how it delivers value, how it was built, and where it's going next. It's essentially a comprehension tool which shows you the product vision and evolution in a single diagram.

If a sprint shows you the tree, a story map shows you the forest.


It's not a replacement for Jira, Asana, Phabricator, or any other project management tool. It's the missing layer that sits alongside them. Your issue tracker tells you what work needs doing. Your story map tells you why it matters and where it fits.

### Why It Matters

Agile workflows like Scrum and Kanban are great at showing you what you're building right now. They're not always great at showing you how it connects to everything else. Long-running projects often follow the same pattern: they start with energy, vision and shared understanding, and six months later that coherent picture of the product has been replaced by a giant backlog. Everyone knows what their tickets are. Nobody can point to a single place that shows how all that work fits together as a product. The vision that started the project isn't lost because people forgot it. It's lost because nothing in the workflow preserves it.

A story map preserves it. One diagram that shows who the users are, what journey they take, what features support each step, and what's been delivered versus what's planned. You can point at a section and say 'we've got the same approval flow duplicated across three journeys, let's consolidate it' or 'there's nothing between checkout and delivery, we're missing the order confirmation step.' You can draw a line across the map and say 'everything above this is V1, let's push biometrics and reporting to V2.' The product vision stays visible, not as a document nobody reads, but as a living artifact the team works from, refers back to, and can update as the product evolves.

###   Agile Backlogs Hide Complexity. Story Maps Expose It.

By mapping out the user journey upfront, you can instantly spot functional gaps. For example, say you're building an online store for a local sign shop. You plan out steps: "Browse Designs" → "Customise Text" → "Confirm Dimensions" → "Approve" → "Checkout". That seems like a sensible linear flow in your backlog.

You start implementation, work through the first three stages, and hit "Approve", only to realise you forgot to account for what happens if the customer's design isn't approved. Implementation pauses. After discussing it with stakeholders, you add "Revise Design" → "Revise Dimensions" → "Re-approve". Your workload just went from five steps to eight, mid-sprint... sound familiar?

This kind of hidden complexity surfaces repeatedly in projects. It's nobody's fault, but it impacts everyone: scope creep and uncomfortable conversations about why things are taking longer than expected. Even agile isn't immune to this.

With story mapping, everyone is in the room during the mapping session. The question "What happens if they don't approve?" surfaces early because the team is walking through the user's journey together, step by step. You have the conversation before implementation starts, capture it in the map, and reduce disruptions while building shared understanding across the team.

You've probably seen these patterns in your own work. It happens to us all. It's hard to quantify, and that's why it's frustrating. But a good heuristic is this: think about how long you thought your last project or complex feature would take, and compare it to how long it actually took. The difference is your hidden complexity tax. It's not a mistake, it's just a blindspot in how agile manages complexity. Story mapping won't eliminate that gap entirely, but it shrinks it by surfacing the unknowns before they become surprises. Try creating a story map for your current project, or start small by mapping a single feature or process. Share it with your team and get their feedback. Don't get hung up on making the perfect map. The goal isn't a perfect diagram, it's a better shared understanding of what you're building. Keep that in mind and see where it takes you.

### Here's the basic structure of a story map:
- **Users** - Who are the users? e.g. first-time shopper
- **Activities** - What are they trying to achieve? e.g. find a product
- **Steps** - The journey they take to achieve their goals from left to right e.g. search -> browse -> compare
- **Tasks** - The work to support each step e.g. keyword search, category filters, compare products
- **Slices** - Horizontal groupings for releases (MVP, v1, v2, etc.)

## App Features

### Story Mapping
- **Users, Activities & Steps (Backbone)** - define the user journey left-to-right
- **Task cards** - break down work under each step
- **Release slices** - group tasks into MVP, V1, V2 etc.; mark slices complete to collapse them
- **Status indicators** - done, in-progress, planned, blocked with per-slice progress tracking
- **Story points** - estimate effort per card, auto-summed per slice
- **Tags** - categorize cards with free-text tags, autocomplete from existing tags
- **Legend** - define colour-coded card categories (e.g. Tasks, Notes, Questions, Edge Cases)
- **Map Partials** - reusable story map fragments that eliminate duplication when multiple user journeys converge on shared steps; extract a sequence of columns once, reference it from anywhere, and expand inline to see the detail
- **Expanded view** - click the expand button on any card to see and edit all details in a larger modal
- **Card colours & links** - 14 colours, external URLs to issue trackers
- **Drag & drop** - reorder cards, columns, and slices
- **Hide columns** - insert spacer columns to visually group steps

### Search & Filter
- **Search** (Ctrl+F) - live search with non-matching cards dimmed
- **Filter panel** - filter by status, colour, or tag; combine multiple filters

### Multi-Select & Bulk Edit
- **Select cards** - click, Shift+click, or marquee-drag to select multiple cards
- **Selection toolbar** - bulk change colour, status, or tags; duplicate or delete selected items

### Collaboration
- **Real-time sync** - multiple users editing simultaneously (Yjs CRDTs)
- **Live cursors** - see other users' cursor positions and drag operations
- **Collaborative notepad** - shared notes that sync in real-time
- **Viewer count** - see how many people are viewing the map
- **Shareable URLs** - each map gets a unique link
- **Lock maps** - password-protect to prevent edits

### Import & Export
- **JSON** - import/export story maps as JSON files
- **YAML** - import/export as human-readable YAML; author maps in a text editor, version-control them in git, or generate from scripts
- **Jira** - export as CSV or via REST API
- **Asana** - export as CSV or via REST API
- **Phabricator** - export via Maniphest API
- **URL endpoints** - append `.json` or `.yaml` to any map URL to fetch its data programmatically (e.g. `curl storymaps.io/abc123.json`)
- **Share as image** - copy map screenshot to clipboard or download as PNG
- **Print / PDF**

### Navigation
- **Infinite canvas** - Ctrl+scroll to zoom, right-click drag or touch-drag to pan
- **Pinch-to-zoom** - two-finger pinch to zoom on touch devices
- **Zoom to fit** (Alt+R / Shift+0) - auto-fit all content to viewport
- **Keyboard shortcuts** - undo/redo (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y), search (Ctrl+F), duplicate (Ctrl+D), delete (Delete/Backspace), zoom, pan

### Other
- **Undo / Redo** (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y)
- **Focus Mode** - hide card metadata (status, points, tags, links) for a cleaner presentation view
- **Copy map** - duplicate an existing map to a new URL
- **Sample maps** - load examples to learn the methodology
- **Map counter** - community stat showing total maps created
- **Auto-save** - continuous save to local storage and server

## Architecture

The app is a single Node.js server (`server.js`) that handles:
- **WebSocket** - Real-time collaboration via y-websocket
- **Static files** - Serves the client app from `public/` and `src/`
- **REST API** - Lock state (`/api/lock/:mapId`), stats (`/api/stats`), and format endpoints (`/:mapId.json`, `/:mapId.yaml`)

### Data Storage
- **LevelDB** - Yjs document persistence in `yjs-data/`
- **SQLite** - Map index with names and timestamps (`yjs-data/maps.db`)
- **JSON files** - Lock state (`yjs-data/locks.json`) and counters (`yjs-data/stats.json`)

### Client
The client has no build step - ES modules are loaded directly from `src/`. Third-party libraries (Yjs, CodeMirror) are vendored as pre-built bundles in `public/vendor/`.

## Self-Hosting

Storymaps is a single Docker container behind a Caddy reverse proxy. It runs on any Linux server and gives your team a private instance at e.g. `storymaps.yourcompany.com` with automatic HTTPS.

### Prerequisites
- A Linux server (VM, VPS, or container platform) - 512 MB RAM / 1 vCPU is sufficient
- Docker and Docker Compose
- A domain or subdomain with DNS pointing to the server

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jackgleeson/userstorymaps.git
   cd userstorymaps
   ```
2. Edit the `Caddyfile` - replace `storymaps.io` with your domain and remove the `www` and `new` redirect blocks:
   ```
   storymaps.yourcompany.com {
       reverse_proxy app:8080
   }
   ```
3. Build and start:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```
4. Visit `https://storymaps.yourcompany.com` - Caddy provisions TLS automatically via Let's Encrypt.

### Behind an Existing Reverse Proxy

If you already run nginx, Traefik, HAProxy, or another proxy, you can skip Caddy and expose the app directly.

1. Remove the `caddy` service from `docker-compose.yml` and expose port 8080 on the `app` service:
   ```yaml
   services:
     app:
       image: storymaps-app
       build: .
       restart: unless-stopped
       volumes:
         - ./yjs-data:/app/yjs-data
       ports:
         - "8080:8080"
   ```
2. Point your existing proxy at `localhost:8080` and handle TLS termination there.

   Example nginx snippet:
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 443 ssl;
       server_name storymaps.yourcompany.com;

       ssl_certificate     /path/to/cert.pem;
       ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
       }
   }
   ```
   The `Upgrade` and `Connection` headers are required for WebSocket connections.

### Data & Backups

All data lives in `./yjs-data/` on the host:
- LevelDB files - Yjs document state
- `maps.db` - SQLite map index
- `locks.json` - lock state
- `stats.json` - counters

Back up this directory regularly (e.g. a cron job with `tar` or `rsync`). To migrate to a new server, copy `yjs-data/` across and start the containers.

### Updating

```bash
git pull && docker compose up -d --build
```

Data is preserved across rebuilds since `yjs-data/` is a host-mounted volume.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT`   | `8080`  | Server listen port |

### Running Locally (Development)

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:8080`.
